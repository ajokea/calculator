In this project, I used my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, as well as HTML and CSS, to create an on-screen calculator with basic functionality.

The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive and negative numbers (integers and decimals). It has some logic to handle overflow if the number is too big for the calculator display. The user can use the 'AC' button to clear the calculator data and use the 'DEL' key to delete or backspace a digit/decimal. The calculator displays a silly comment "no chance!" if the user attempts to divide by zero. 

The calculator operates on two numbers at a time, so it doesn't follow PEMDAS (maybe in a future version!).
